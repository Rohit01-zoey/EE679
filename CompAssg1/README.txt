This folder has :
1. .html file for the code and explanations and discussions
2. .ipynb notebook
3. .wav files generated

I was not able to generate the sounds in the notebook itself. So, I have saved them using the code.


[IMP]One can upload the ipynb notebook on colab and select 'Run all'. All .wav files should generate in the same folder for if you want to verify!!!
